✨ Welcome to my GitHub profile! ✨

Here you can find most of my projects I've been working on lately. 
Right now I'm creating libraries for Front-end JavaScript and NodeJS,
while at the same time learning a lot of the existing technologies out there. 
In the meantime I'm plowing through K&R C Programming language and re-learning a lot of highschool/college math for future projects.
